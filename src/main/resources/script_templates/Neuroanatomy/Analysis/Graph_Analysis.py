info:       Demonstrates how to handle neurons as graph structures[1] (graph theory)
            in which nodes connected by edges define the morphology of the neuron.
            SNT represents neurons as directed graphs (assuming the root -typically
            the soma- as origin) and allows data be processed using the powerful
            jgrapht[2] library.
            In this demo, the graph diameter[3] (i.e., the length of the longest
            shortest path or the longest graph geodesic) of a cellular compartment
            is computed for a neuron fetched from the MouseLight database.
